# ETL Project

---

## Project Background

This project was devised by Luke Fairbass of Sparta Global for Sparta UK’s Academy and Talent data.

---

## Project Introduction

Sparta Global runs academies across different streams such as Business, Data, and Engineering. Candidate and academy information was stored in separate CSV files across folders like Academy and Talent. These contained details on applications, Sparta Day assessments, psychometric scores, training results, and talent decisions.

The problem was that the data was spread across many files, with duplicates and inconsistent formats. This made it difficult to:
- See a single candidate’s full journey from application through training.
- Compare cohorts, streams, and trainers.
- Analyse strengths, weaknesses, and technical skills across candidates.

Our task was to design and implement an ETL pipeline that would clean, standardise, and combine this data into a 3NF database schema, enabling Sparta to better analyse candidates, cohorts, and outcomes.
